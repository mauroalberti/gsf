# gsf 
**gsf** is a library for the processing of structural geology data. It is developed in Python 3 (module *pygsf*).

## Installation as a Python 3 module

You should have *python-setuptools* already installed, if not you can install in a Linux Mint shell via apt or pip3, e.g.:
```
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
```
To install *gsf*, from the shell you can run in Linux Mint:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
You can then check if the module is installed in Python3 by successfully importing the module via:
```python
import pygsf
```
## Docs

There are a few Jupyter notebooks describing some of the features of the module in the docs/notebooks folder.
